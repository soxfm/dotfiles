# README.md
----

these are my dotfiles; there are many like it; but, these dotfiles are mine.
in general. most of the stuff here has been adapted/transformed/modded/built upon/copied/rewritten/stolen/pluged
from several different sources
and to be quite honest; i haven't really kept track of the originals(they are around somewhere in GitHub or GitLab tough).
